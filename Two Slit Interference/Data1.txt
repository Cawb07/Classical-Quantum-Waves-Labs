part 4 Alligning the Apparatus

8. Aligning the micrometer: 3.8 mm

10. A reading in which the double slit
images are centered in the blocker slit
opening. 5 mm

A reading in which one slit image is
blocked. 3.64 mm and 5.42 mm for other slit

A reading for which both slits are blocked
by one side of the blocker slit. 3.4 mm

A reading for which both slits are blocked
by the other side of the blocker slit. 5.85 mm
